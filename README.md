#Forgetmenot!

###Let's face it, everyone these days always has their phone on them and are always checking it. Why not take advantage of this to remind ourselve of important tasks!?

###Always forgetting your anniversary or family birthdays? New due date on bills next month? Set up a reminder text so you never forget anything again! (As long as you don't forget your phone!)
